I'm really enjoying your service. It’s cheap, easy to use, and easy to 
manage my account. But I wish it included a way to export all of the 
data to an excel spreadsheet. I currently have to do this manually by 
copying data cell-by-cell, and it’s quite consuming. This change would 
make me more efficient.
